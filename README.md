# V – Christmas Tree

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
In this moment
I see you
It always comes around
As I believed
When the rain stops
You shine on me
Your light’s the only thing
that keeps the cold out
Moon in the summer night
Whispering of the stars
They’re singing like
Christmas trees for us
So I’ll tell you
A Million tiny things that
You have never known
It all gets tangled up inside
And I’ll tell you
A Million little reasons
I’m falling for your eyes
I just want to be where you are
It’s such a strange thing to do
Sometimes
I don’t understand you
But It always brings me back
To where you are
혹시 아니
너에겐 나만 아는 모습이 있어
한여름밤 오는 첫눈같이
믿기지 않는 기적 같은
놀라운 순간, 넌
언젠가 또
불어온 바람에
마음이 날아다녀도
기다릴게
So I’ll tell you
A Million tiny things that
You have never known
It all gets tangled up inside
And I’ll tell you
A Million little reasons
I’m falling for your eyes
I just want to be where you are
Tell you
A Million tiny things that
You have never known
It all gets tangled up inside
Tell you
A Million little reasons
I’m falling for your eyes
I just want to be where you are
