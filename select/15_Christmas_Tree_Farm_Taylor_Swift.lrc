[00:03.82] My winter nights are taken up by static
[00:09.33] Stress and holiday shopping traffic
[00:14.24] But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
[00:19.15] Just like, magic
[00:27.15] 
[00:29.21] In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
[00:31.75] Where the people would come
[00:33.88] To dance under sparkles and lights
[00:36.33] Bundled up in their mittens and coats
[00:38.86] And the cider would flow
[00:41.05] And I just wanna be there tonight
[00:57.55] 
[00:43.49] Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
[00:46.22] Mistakes are forgiven
[00:48.16] And everything is icy and blue
[00:52.17] And you would be there, too
[01:05.67] 
[00:56.35] Under the mistletoe
[00:59.96] Watching the fire glow
[01:03.40] And telling me, "I love you"
[01:10.97] Just being in your arms
[01:14.04] Takes me back to that little farm
[01:17.90] Where every wish comes true
[01:31.40] 
[01:26.67] In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
[01:29.05] There's a light in the barn
[01:31.22] We'd run inside out from the cold
[01:33.60] In the town kids are dreaming of sleighs
[01:36.15] And they're warm and they're safe
[01:38.41] They wake to see a blanket of snow
[01:55.41] 
[01:40.87] Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
[01:43.61] Mistakes are forgiven
[01:45.56] And everything is icy and blue
[01:49.68] And you would be there, too
[02:03.18] 
[01:53.89] Under the mistletoe
[01:57.27] Watching the fire glow
[02:00.70] And telling me, "I love you"
[02:14.70] 
[02:08.03] Just being in your arms
[02:11.11] Takes me back to that little farm
[02:15.12] Where every wish comes true
[02:28.62] 
[02:21.18] Oh baby, yeah
[02:23.50] And when I'm feeling alone
[02:25.45] You remind me of home
[02:27.46] Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
[02:30.96] And when the world isn't fair
[02:32.85] I pretend that we're there
[02:34.68] Baby, baby, Merry Christmas... to you
[02:53.18] 
[02:42.22] Under the mistletoe (To you)
[02:45.82] Watching the fire glow
[02:49.23] And telling me, "I love you"
[03:03.23] 
[02:54.38] Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
[02:57.83] Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
[03:01.40] Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
[03:04.62] I love you
[03:09.62] 
[03:08.73] Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
[03:12.08] Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
[03:15.47] Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
[03:18.55] May your every wish comes true
[03:33.55] 
[03:33.29] I love you
