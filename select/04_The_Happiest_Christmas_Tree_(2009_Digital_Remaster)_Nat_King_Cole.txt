With a hey and a hee and a ho ho
With a hee and a ho and a ha ha
With a ho and a hah and a hee hee

I'm the happiest Christmas tree
Ho ho ho, hee hee hee
Someone came and they found me
And took me home with them
Oh, I'm the happiest Christmas tree
Ho ho ho, hee hee hee
Look how pretty they dressed me
Oh, lucky, lucky me

I got shiny bells that jingle
And tiny lights that tingle
Whenever anyone passes by
I blink my lights and I wink my eye

Oh, I'm the happiest Christmas tree
Christmas day, wait and see
I'll be laughing happily
With a ho-ho-ho-hee-hee

With a hey and a hee and a ho ho
With a hee and a ho and a ha ha
With a ho and a hah and a hee hee

Oh, I'm the happiest Christmas tree
Ho ho ho, hee hee hee
Someone came and they found me
And took me home with them

Oh, I'm the happiest Christmas tree
Ho ho ho, hee hee hee
Look how pretty they dressed me
Oh, lucky, lucky me

I got shiny bells that jingle
And tiny lights that tingle
Whenever anyone passes by
I blink my lights and I wink my eye

Oh, I'm the happiest Christmas tree
Christmas day, wait and see
I'll be laughing happily
With a ho-ho-ho-hee-hee

With a hey and a hee and a ho ho
With a hee and a ho and a ha ha
With a hey and a hee and a ho ho
With a hee and a ho and a ha ha
With a hey and a hee and a ho ho

With a hee and a ho and a ha ha
With a hee and a ho...
